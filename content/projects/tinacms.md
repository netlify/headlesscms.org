## Tina Is Not A CMS

Tina is a **lightweight but powerful toolkit** for creating a content editing interface with JavaScript components. Tina surfaces superpowers for developers to create an intuitive UI for real-time content editing, built directly into their website.

## The Next Generation of Content Management

Tina currently supports React-based frameworks, including:

- Create-React-App
