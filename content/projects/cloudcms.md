## Definitions for Cloud CMS (noun)

1. A decoupled JSON and binary content platform that provides a high performance, transactional API to Create Once and Publish Everywhere

2. A headless CMS with a rich and extensible user interface so that your editorial team can create, manage and publish fresh content to your web sites and mobile apps with ease

3. A powerful content engine that runs in the cloud or on-premise using Docker, letting you plug it right into your API-oriented, low-latency microservices-based applications

4 The content backend that you'd build if you had the time to do it well

Cloud CMS is a headless, API-first approach to content management, built around JSON and a high performance cloud architecture. It delivers enterprise features, including flexible content models and a full editorial environment, allowing your business users create, manage and publish fresh content with ease.

Cloud CMS is available either as a hosted subscription or as a series of Docker microservices that you can run on-premise or host within your own private cloud. Cloud CMS runs on top of MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Amazon AWS.
