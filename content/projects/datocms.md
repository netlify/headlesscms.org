## DatoCMS
DatoCMS is a friendly, secure and powerful platform that enables marketer, editorial or developer team to build complex backend in minutes and to bring any kind of content everywhere.

###Api first
DatoCMS is an API-based CMS: all the content is accessible via API. We offer [Content Delivery API in GraphQL](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/?utm_source=headlesscms.org&utm_medium=project&utm_campaign=headlesscms.org) and [Content Management API](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api/?utm_source=headlesscms.org&utm_medium=project&utm_campaign=headlesscms.org).

###Take care of your content, we do the rest
Don't care about servers, maintenance, security. Take care only about your content.

###Any kind of content
With DatoCMS you can build and manage any kind of content. Literally. Forget templates or predefined structures: choose your own way to organize your content.

###GraphQL
The Content Delivery API is written in GraphQL, which offers a number of advantages over classic REST APIs:
- Strongly typed schema
- No more over-fetching and under-fetching
- Fewer roundtrips

###Plugin
Plugins aim to provide an amazing experience for DatoCMS editors, by letting developers replace the default fields that DatoCMS provides with third-party HTML5 applications, so the editing experience of every DatoCMS project can be fully customized.

###Features

####Modular content
Rich text fields, images, geopoints, complex relationships, SEO/social sharing settings... DatoCMS makes it easy to build a tailored authoring experience for your editors and marketers.
Create any kind of object — pages, products, case studies. Just drag and drop fields into your model and everything will be instantly editable.

####Powerful image manipulation
Every DatoCMS plan comes with the power of Imgix, a extremely powerful and fast CDN that allows you to perform any kind of manipulation to the uploaded assets.
Optimize, resize, crop, rotate and watermark images on-the-fly simply adding custom parameters to the URL of your image.

####Dynamic layouts
With DatoCMS you can achieve structured, rich-content editing using a specific type of field called Modular Content.
Give your authors the freedom to compose inspiring visual stories by alternating a number of reusable custom components without depending on the development team.

####100% Whitelabel
Customize theme colors, logo, custom domain.. you can easily setup DatoCMS to match your — or your clients' — brand identity.
We don't want to get in the way: your editors will hardly notice the presence of a third-party CMS.

####Multi-language
DatoCMS offers full localization support. All your content types and assets can be localizable, including rich text, images, geopoints and especially your URLs.

####Tree-like structures
Taxonomies, product categories, navigation bars... websites are full of hierarchical data. DatoCMS is the only headless CMS that supports tree-like data structures out-of-the-box, offering a delightful editing experience for your editors and marketers.

####Single instance models
Most headless CMS solutions only allow the creation of collections of objects (ie. articles, case studies, etc.), but websites often have pages that don’t resemble any other — eg. the "About us" page, or even the homepage.
If you want to allow your editors to manage their content, in DatoCMS you can create what we call single instance models.

####Customizable navigation bar
When your website gets bigger, the number of models in your administrative area will grow as well, so for editors it might quickly become difficult to understand which part of the backend is linked to which part of the frontend website.
With DatoCMS you can easily organize the navigation bar of your administrative area: group, rename and reorder menu items so that their purpose will be more clear to your editors.

####User roles
Simply put, DatoCMS offers the most thorough roles/permissions system you can find in the headless CMS market.
Build the perfect publication workflow for your team, precisely determining what actions every team member can perform inside the administrative area (ie. "user has read-only permissions on every content, except for articles which can be freely created/updated but not deleted nor published online").

####Revision History
Never lose a change thanks to revision history: DatoCMS keeps track of all drafts and publications of your content, in a simple concise view, displayed together with the change date and its author.
DatoCMS offers a powerful diff visualization of changes between content revisions. Preview what has changed not only in rich text, but also in images, links, geopoints, and every other rich fragment.

####Search engine
If you're using DatoCMS to build a static website, you'll be happy to know that we support an easy way to offer to your website visitors site-wide search functionality at no additional cost.
You can think of DatoCMS Search as a replacement for the now discontinued Google Site Search: just add our themable Javascript widget, we'll take care of the rest.

####Strong consistent API
DatoCMS offers an all-encompassing, strong API you can rely on to build scripts and automate anything.
A subtle, but fundamental difference from other competitors is that we offer immediate consistency instead of eventual consistency: this means that your actions will always be predictable — an especially important property to have during import/export of data.

####Security
We take the security of our users very seriously.
Both the administrative area and the API run on HTTPS, we have continuous data protection in place, and you can even enforce two-factor authentication to your editors using the Google Authenticator app.
