## What is Storyblok

Storyblok builds a bridge between content creators and developers - without to force the developer into a technology. The main mission of Storyblok is to make the web faster - in development and maintenance! We want the content creator to write articles, stories and even build landing pages in one platform and still allow the developers to access the information in well structured content from an performant API.

### For whom?

Storyblok is for developers who like to take their time and do things right, building out their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by hand. This is not a site builder or some sort of design tool.

### For what?

Storyblok was built to be unbelievable scalable and flexible, to the point that even its own feature set can adapt perfectly to the scope of the project (have a look at the Apps section in your Space). Whether you’re building a portfolio site or a big corporate site, Storyblok is a scalable and flexible choice for that. You can even use Storyblok in existing projects and enrich the content of any system with editorial content.

### Tech Specs

Storyblok is a headless, API-based SaaS CMS built with Ruby on Rails and VueJS as it’s core, but you don’t need to know Ruby or VueJs to use it. You can go with your favorite technologies and build awesome stuff with us. If you need more than a simple to use Content Delivery API and looking for a full stack you can still opt-in our Cloud Rendering Service without losing the access to your data at all.
