## Scrivito

Scrivito is a user friendly, secure and serverless JavaScript SaaS CMS – built for digital agencies and medium to large sized businesses.

Its backend is API-driven and running on AWS, but it comes with a beautiful ReactJS SDK to render pages client-side in the browser.

Based on ReactJS, Scrivito is completely maintenance-free, cost-effective, and has unprecedented security. It combines unmatched WYSIWYG usability for editors with maximum flexibility for developers.

And because Scrivito renders all pages client-side, it is 100% serverless, you’ll never have to patch your CMS, so it’s the most secure and cost-effective solution on the market.

See [our 3' explainer video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=RBLwKTEZr00).

### 100% maintenance free

And CTOs love our reliability – because we eliminate the need for constant patching, thanks to our scalable, secure serverless and 100% maintenance-free approach. All pages are rendered in the browser, no server required. The JS hosting is integrated with Netlify.

### Built for ReactJS

Developers love our flexibility – because Scrivito is 100% JavaScript, it is at the forefront of the current JavaScript web development revolution - leveraging cutting-edge technologies like client-side rendering and Facebook’s ReactJS.

### WYSIWYG editing

Editors love our usability – because our WYSIWYG editing lets them place content and widgets directly on the pages using drag-and-drop, exactly where they want it. This is where all other headless CMS lack. So call Scrivito a headless CMS, but with a head.
