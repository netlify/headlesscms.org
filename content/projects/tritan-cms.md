## TriTan CMS
TriTan CMS is a developer centric, lightweight content management system (CMS) and content management framework (CMF). It is easy to install, easy to manage, and easy to extend. The majority of TriTan's codebase is derived from WordPress, however, TriTan is not a fork of WordPress. It also should not be seen as a replacement for WordPress, Drupal, Joomla or any of the top used CMS's out there.

The main purpose of TriTan is to give developer's an option that is geared toward how they think, how they code, and how they build websites. Although you can use TriTan for your traditional CMS needs, you can also use it to build API centric applications.
