## Mozaik

Not just another content management system, but an API-first, developer friendly backend with a straightforward content editor UI.

### The right tools and workflow

* Manage your content modelling in our dashboard, or control it through code and keep it part of your repo.
* Use your favourite languages or frameworks. Just a simple HTTP request and deliver your content to any device.
* One request to rule them all: get your data in one go. A built-in GraphQL IDE, and always up-to-date API documentation.

### Easy and rich content editing
* Create drafts, manage versions, publish changes, and schedule posts with a seamless content editor UI.
* Preview changes before publishing, and always know the full version history of a document.
* Define custom workflows and permissions that makes your team more productive.
