## Building self-hosted, customizable and performant Content APIs has never been easier.

Strapi is an open sourced Headless CMS Front-End Developers Love. It's more than a Node.js Framework and more than a Headless CMS, it saves API development time through a beautiful admin panel anyone can use.

### Open source

Free and open source, forever. The entire codebase is available on GitHub and is maintained by hundreds of contributors.

### Self-hosted

Security is crucial for companies. Host your data safely, on your own servers. GDPR compliant.

### Customizable

Each project requires specific requirements. Easily customize the admin panel as well as the API.

### RESTful or GraphQL

Consume the API from any client (React, Vue, Angular), mobile apps or even IoT, using REST or GraphQL.

### 100% JavaScript

One language to rule them all. Use JavaScript everywhere: both for your front-end and your Headless CMS.

### Extensible by design

Plugins system included. Install auth system, content management, custom plugins, and more, in seconds.

### Authentications & Permissions

Secure your endpoints by allowing or not allowing users to access your API by role.
