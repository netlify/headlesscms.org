## NodeWrite
Collaborate across multiple workspaces within a single application instance. Create custom content types which are exposed via an automatic content API and publish localized content that's managed using your preferred language. Multimedia asset management includes support for resumable file uploads. Generate workspace specific roles with permissions to define privileges matching your requirements.
