## DatoCMS
DatoCMS is a fully customizable administrative area for your static websites. Use your favorite website generator, let your clients publish new content independently, host the site anywhere you like.

### How does it work?
All the websites built with a static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.) are made of:

- Static files — usually Markdown+Frontmatter or YAML/JSON/Toml config files which represent the actual content of the pages;
- HTML templates that use these content files to generate the actual static pages of the website.

Up until now, even the most basic change to a static website could only be performed by tech-savvy users, as too many things had to be known (Git, Markdown, etc). DatoCMS lets you tackle the problem in a different way:

1. You create a DatoCMS administrative area that fits exactly the needs of your website;
2. Editors change the contents of the website inside a nice web interface, just like they're used to do with ie. Wordpress;
3. Using our plugins, all the stored data gets transformed into local Markdown/config files, so that can be "digested" by the static website generator just as it was written by hand.

When the editors press the "Publish" button, a new website build gets triggered and updated content is deployed online.
