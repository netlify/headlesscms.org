Sanity is a headless, real-time CMS where the front end is an open source
React-based construction kit and the back end is a graph-oriented cloud
datastore with a globally distributed CDN.

## Quick start

`npm install -g @sanity/cli && sanity init`

Read the
[documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/introduction/getting-started) on how
to get started

## Real-time CMS

Edit structured, highly connected documents collaboratively

## Lightweight & pluggable

Extend with your own data types, custom user interfaces and third-party
integrations.

## Block editor

Rich text editor yields structured data. Embed editable data in running text.
Defer markup to render time. No HTML, ever!
