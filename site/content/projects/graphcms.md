description: GraphCMS is a GraphQL Based Headless Content Management System
---
## Our Mission
Being developers, it was easy to understand that traditional content management systems could not keep up with the requirements of modern, multichannel app development. The mobile and internet of things revolution is forcing CMS vendors to rethink their product strategies, as content now lives on multiple platforms. REST based, API-first content management systems, so called headless content management systems entered the landscape as a logical consequence. And while REST is basically doing the trick, it has some limitations that make developing sites and applications a pain. Our mission is to remove these pain points by using the power of GraphQL and take the idea of a headless CMS to the next level.
