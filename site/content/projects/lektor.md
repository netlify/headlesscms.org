## Lektor
A flexible and powerful static content management system for building complex and beautiful websites out of flat files — for people who do not want to make a compromise between a CMS and a static blog engine.

### Deploy Anywhere

Because Lektor builds out 100% static HTML you can deploy them to any host (including S3, GitHub Pages, any web host, etc.).

### Cross Platform

It runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.

### 100% File Based

All source data is well structured and can be tracked in a version control system or cloud storage like Dropbox.

### Flat-File Database

All source data is stored in a flat-file tree database and can be freely queried. The layout of that data is completely configurable.

### Customizable Admin

Lektor comes fully equipped with a flexible and beautiful admin interface so you can edit your pages without having to touch the raw sources.

### Dependency Tracking

The build process intelligently tracks page dependencies such that it only rebuilds pages that have changed.

### Image Tools

Create thumbnails and give convenient access to EXIF data.

### Plugin System

Lektor supports loading plugins that can customize a wide range of functionality.

### Python API

The build system is written in Python and provides a documented API to extend it and integrate into other apps.

### Multilingual

We can speak multiple languages and allow you to easily create localized websites.
