## The quickest and most flexible way to make your content editable.

Storyblok is a decoupled/headless cms - we removed the front-end component (the head) and, what remains is our content delivery RESTful API.

Most of the Content Management Systems force you into a specific way on how to develop a website. 
With Storyblok you can just plug in the service to your template. 
There is no need to take care of CMS installation or database setup.

## Reusable Components

The key concepts behind Storyblok are highly inspired by the BEM methodology. 
The author of a story can create a nested tree of components and input content in an easy and fast responding interface.
You can then call the read-only CDN with the JSON tree and render your components in a loop.

## Side By Side Editing

One major difference to other API Driven CMS Systems is the way we allow developer to edit side by side to their real content.
With storyblok you can edit your website, app or similar with just one line of a comment - that's it.
