## BowTie
BowTie professional site builder. Build fast and lean websites for your clients that don't skimp on features.

### Simple Sites are Better Sites
Database-driven websites expose your clients to security risks, and often require complex optimization and maintenance.

BowTie helps you deploy websites that are faster, easier to maintain, and more secure than a traditional content management system - without losing convenience.

### Dynamic Features
The benefits of a static site – enhanced to make content creation, and project maintenance easy.

BowTie gives you Stripe Payments, User Management, Zapier, and a Hosted Content Editor without a database.

### Let Them Do the Editing
Handing off content creation? Clients and non-technical collaborators can use a customized editor to modify only what they need to.

Developers can manage access to content, roll back changes with git version control, and work locally with familiar tools.

### Worry Free Websites
Database driven legacy sites are needlessly complex and susceptible to known exploits – and we all pay the price.

BowTie captures information (behavior, payments, custom data) securely when you need persistent data. There's no software to maintain, and no database to hack.

### Time Saved for Visitors and Clients
Deliver lightning fast content to your visitors, on secure, scalable cloud infrastructure.

Use our template framework to produce brochures, donation sites, or simple e-commerce sites quickly – allowing you to focus on what matters, design and content.
