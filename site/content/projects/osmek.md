## Osmek isn't just a CMS, it's a Content API.

It's time to rethink what you know about content management. Osmek takes the framework out of CMS, and that changes everything.

### Language Independent

PHP, Ruby, Javascript, Objective-C, .NET - Osmek doesn't care.

### Freedom from Frameworks

You should choose your code framework, not your CMS.

### Reduced Dev Time

Get things done faster with Osmek in your corner.

### API Access

Your content - available any time, any where. And with full create, read, update, and delete support, the sky is the limit. Learn More.

### Content Bins

Design your Osmek interface around the needs of your content, not the other way around. Learn More.

### Users

Multiple users and fine grained permissions controls give you incredible control.
