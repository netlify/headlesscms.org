## Contentful

Contentful is a content management developer platform with an API at its core.

### API-first, not browser-first

All the created content is accessible via an API. Bring your content anywhere, display it as you like.

### Scalable cloud, not on-premises setup

Your content is stored on our servers. They are fast, safe, secure, and we take care of all the maintenance.

### Content-centric, not page-centric

Organize and structure the content your way. Build a custom content model instead of dealing with fixed, predefined templates.

### Just the content, no presets or templates

Contentful delivers the content, and you design around it. We separate the content from presentation — it's most flexible this way.
