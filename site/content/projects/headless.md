## Headless
Content & translation management for your static website.

### Content management
Model your own content as developer and let editors do the writing.

### Internationalization
Headless is built with i18n in mind from the start. Not only is the content multi language but you can also use the translations tool to easily translate your entire website.

### API based
Use our easy Content API to fetch your content and add it to your build process. Perfect to host on Netlify.
